# Todo List - September 9, 2025
## Deji's Big Marble Workshop Tasks

### **Slide Development & Content**
- [ ] Add visual elements - Add "more flow charts and just more diagrammatic descriptions" instead of all text
- [ ] Implement feedback from the recording - Take the feedback from the Read.AI recording and implement that as well
- [ ] Coordinate slide formatting with Simon - Link up and get coordinated on the format to resolve style differences between slides

### **Content Refinements**
- [ ] Pare down complex concepts - Remove or simplify the post-training and RAG sections that were "getting into the weeds"
- [ ] Add post-training as footnotes - Incorporate post-training expertise into the presentation as footnotes rather than full sections
- [ ] Rework the ROI calculator - Replace or modify the ROI calculator that feels too "salesy"

### **Section 5 Preparation**
- [ ] Develop implementation-focused content - Go "full implementation mode" with flowcharts for section 5
- [ ] Figure out how to showcase Jay's platform - Determine the best way to show Jay's platform visually for a walkthrough
- [ ] Balance demo time effectively - Use the 30-minute timeframe without being too "salesy"

### **Technical Tasks**
- [ ] Upload slides to the new format - Extract quiz questions and upload to Simon's current interactive format
- [ ] Format quizzes properly - Reformat quiz content for Simon's new interactive system

### **Timeline Notes**
